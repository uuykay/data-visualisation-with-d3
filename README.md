# Information Visualization: Programming with D3

The D3 assignment for the above named Coursera course. Part 3 in a 4 part specialisation for data visualisation.

The code style does not reflect my own workflow, simply the workflow required by the course (submission based on JS in the HTML file, no tooling).

## How to run:

- Boot up a local server e.g. install serve with npm serve -g, and serve the folder with serve.
